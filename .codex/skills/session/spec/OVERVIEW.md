# Spec Phase

Define WHAT to build and WHY using a question-driven approach.

## Purpose

The spec phase captures requirements, goals, and context **before** implementation planning. It answers:
- What problem are we solving?
- What does success look like?
- What are we explicitly NOT building?

## Prerequisites

- New session created with `/session:spec [topic]`
- Or resuming existing session with `/session:spec [session-id]`

## Prior Spec References

When starting a new spec, you may link prior sessions for context:

- **Prompt**: After session creation, agent asks "Are there prior specs to reference?"
- **Storage**: Prior session ID stored in `state.json` as `prior_session` field
- **Context Loading**: If provided, agent reads prior spec.md to understand:
  - Related goals and decisions
  - Constraints that may carry over
  - Continuity with previous work

This enables building on prior work without duplicating context. The prior spec is read but not modified.

**Example state.json with prior reference:**
```json
{
  "prior_session": "2025-12-24_user-auth_k7m3x9",
  ...
}
```

## Workflow

```
1. User provides topic/context
     ↓
2. Create session, prompt for prior specs
     ↓
3. If prior spec: read for context
     ↓
4. Ask clarifying questions
     ↓
5. Draft spec sections iteratively
     ↓
6. User reviews and refines
     ↓
7. Finalize spec → Ready for plan phase
```

## Key Principles

1. **In-depth interviewing**: Ask thorough, non-obvious clarifying questions about literally anything to understand the problem
2. **Almost read-only**: Only write to session directory files
3. **WHAT not HOW**: Focus on outcomes, not implementation
4. **Persistent exploration**: Continue interviewing until the spec is truly complete
5. **Capture the why & user taste**: Don't just record requirements - capture reasoning, mental models, and preferences. Verbose input gets condensed, but nuance must survive.
6. **Atomic persistence**: After EVERY exchange, update spec.md. Never batch updates. This prevents losing work. State tracking (phase, timestamps) is handled via MCP tools when transitioning phases.
7. **Visual communication**: Use the canonical fence vocabulary:
   - ```ascii — entity / data flow / control flow / architecture / state diagrams
   - ```filetree — directory structures with `# new` / `# modified` / `# deleted` line annotations
   - ```sequence — Mermaid sequenceDiagram syntax (only diagram type using Mermaid)

   Embed inline within each design slice rather than batching at the end.

## Spec Document Layout

**Tier 1 — Preamble** (fixed, scannable):
- **Overview** — brief understanding of the problem space
- **Problem Statement** — what we're solving and why it matters
- **Goals** — High-Level / Mid-Level / Detailed, north star to specifics
- **Non-Goals** — explicit exclusions to prevent scope creep
- **Success Criteria** — testable outcomes
- **Context & Background** — prior art, existing systems, stakeholder input

**Tier 2 — Body** (freeform vertical slices):
- **Design** — agent builds vertical-slice subsections as the spec emerges; each slice describes a coherent unit of change with inline ```ascii / ```filetree / ```sequence artifacts. No prescribed sub-headings.
- **Notes** — trailing catch-all scratchpad.

Open questions live in `state.json` only. Key decisions surface organically inside design slices.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/session:spec [topic]` | Start new spec session |
| `/session:spec [session-id]` | Resume existing session |
| `/session:spec [session-id] finalize` | Finalize spec for planning |

## Outputs

- `spec.md` - Specification document containing:
  - Goals (High/Mid/Implementation levels)
  - Open Questions (checkbox format)
  - Key Decisions (with rationale and date)
- `state.json` - Session tracking (managed by MCP tools):
  - `current_phase`, `phases`, `phase_history` timestamps
  - `prior_session` - ID of linked prior spec session (if any)
- `research/` - Any research artifacts gathered

## Finalization Criteria

Before finalizing, ensure:
- [ ] Problem statement is clear
- [ ] High-level goals are defined
- [ ] Non-goals explicitly stated
- [ ] Success criteria are testable

## Finalizing the Spec

When spec is complete and approved by user:

1. Verify all finalization criteria are met
2. Use the MCP tool to transition to plan phase:
   ```
   mcp__session_state__session_transition_phase(
     session_dir=".spectre/sessions/<session-id>",
     new_phase="plan"
   )
   ```
3. This updates `state.json` with:
   - `current_phase: "plan"`
   - `phase_history.spec_completed_at` timestamp
   - `phase_history.plan_started_at` timestamp

**Note**: The MCP tools are available when running via Claude Agent SDK with the session_state MCP server configured.
