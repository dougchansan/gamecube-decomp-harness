# Review Lint Tool Suite

This suite keeps decomp-specific review guardrails in an explicit tool API. It
can scan a file or text snippet for:

- type-erasing pointer casts such as `(void*)`, `(u8*)`, and `(char*)`;
- `M2C_FIELD(...)` residue;
- functions containing multiple distinct `Item*` or `Fighter*` variables,
  which often signals an inlined helper that should be split or reused.

Use this before returning source edits or when PR review needs a quick
decomp-specific anti-pattern check.

## Diff-Aware QA Ship Gate: `api/scan_diff.py`

`scan_diff.py` is the deterministic layer of the QA ship gate
(`docs/10-system-design/60-score-and-pr-handoff.md`). It scans
the ADDED lines of a unified diff — never pre-existing upstream code — for
maintainer-rejected patterns. Input modes:

- `--repo <colosseum-root> [--base <ref>]`: diff `merge-base(ref, HEAD)..HEAD`
  (default base `origin/master`); `--include-worktree` diffs the worktree
  instead of HEAD; `--path <pathspec>` (repeatable) restricts the diff.
- `--repo <colosseum-root> --diff-file <patch>`: scan a pre-computed unified diff
  (the worker-side L1 lint and per-slice pre-ship review use this).

Stdout is always the JSON document
(`{tool, operation, status, repo, base, findings, counts}`); the
human-readable summary goes to stderr. Rules live in `api/_qa_rules.py`
(shared with `scan.py`); the extern ownership analysis is in
`api/check_extern_ownership.py`.

### Rules

| Rule id | Severity | Detects |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `extern_literal_anchor` | warning (error for `char`/`u8`) | Added `extern` declaration of `f32`/`f64`/`float`/`double`/`char`/`u8` with an address-style name (`lbl_804DA60C`-shaped) and no initializer. String types are an immediate error; float types go through the ownership analysis below and either escalate or stay a `cross_tu_ok` warning. |
| `new_data_anchor` | error | Extern, uses, and definition for the same symbol all introduced by this diff: an invented data anchor to force data ordering. |
| `self_tu_extern` | error | Extern whose encoded address falls inside the TU's own section ranges in `splits.txt` — the TU externing data it owns to dodge data ordering. |
| `function_extern_visibility` / `same_tu_function_extern` | warning / error | Added function `extern` declarations. Cross-TU/unknown declarations stay warnings; declarations for functions defined in the same `.c` file escalate to errors because they can hide the same-TU body from MWCC inline-boundary decisions. |
| `string_literal_to_symbol` | error | A string-literal call argument replaced by a data symbol or `ident + 0xNN` offset expression within the same hunk. |
| `numeric_literal_to_symbol` | error | A numeric literal such as `0.0F`, `1.0F`, or `-F32_MAX` replaced by an address-style data symbol within the same hunk. |
| `address_named_static_data` | error | Added `static`/global data definitions with address-style names such as `lbl_804DA60C` or `grSmoke_804D0000`. Exact moved pre-existing lines are downgraded to warnings by the moved-vs-invented pass. |
| `packed_string_blob` | error | Hand-packed `static char name[0xNN] =` blobs concatenating string literals with `\0` padding, or `#define NAME (lbl_8XXXXXXX + 0xNN)` pointer-offset macros. |
| `copied_jobj_inline` | error | Local copies of `jobj.h` inline helper bodies in source TUs instead of calls to canonical `HSD_JObj*` helpers. |
| `stage_ground_var_owner` | error | Stage TUs that add `gv.<member>` accesses for another stage family's GroundVars arm instead of the owning stage arm. |
| `unrolled_assert` | error | Open-coded `__assert`/`__assert_msg` call sites in `src/colosseum/**`/`src/sysdolphin/**` where the source idiom is `HSD_ASSERT*` (macro definitions and continuation lines are skipped). |
| `fake_assert_macro` | error | Added local `#define` macros whose body contains `__assert`, `__assert_msg`, or `OSReport`, or whose name ends in `_ASSERT`, `_ASSERTMSG`, or `_ASSERTREPORT`. |
| `assert_idiom_downgrade` | error | A hunk removes `HSD_ASSERT*` and adds raw `__assert`/`OSReport` code in the same file. |
| `register_keyword` | error | Added `register <type> <ident>` steering in `src/**/*.c`. |
| `inline_asm` | error | Added inline assembly (`asm {`, `asm volatile`, or `asm(...)`) in `src/**/*.c`. |
| `m2c_residue_names` | error / warning | Added `temp_rNN`/`var_rNN`/`phi_fNN`-style locals are errors; typed `spNN` locals are warnings. |
| `m2c_goto_label` | error / warning | Added `goto block_NN` or `block_NN:` labels are errors; other added gotos are warnings. |
| `m2c_field_use` | error | Added `M2C_FIELD(...)` bridge-code uses. |
| `pointer_offset_arithmetic` | warning | Added raw byte-pointer offset arithmetic such as `((u8*) obj) + 0x14`, which should usually become a typed field, correct union arm, helper, or temporary struct. |
| `define_alias` | error / warning | Added identifier/expression `#define` aliases are errors; local `_ABS`/`_MIN`/`_MAX`/`_CLAMP` macro clones are warnings. |
| `novel_pragma` | warning | Added `#pragma` directives outside the upstream-established set (`push`, `pop`, `dont_inline`, `auto_inline`, `force_active`, `fp_contract`, `global_optimizer`, `pool_data`, `clang diagnostic`). |
| `codegen_pragma` | warning | Added established-but-suspicious codegen pragmas (`dont_inline`, `auto_inline`, `global_optimizer`, `pool_data`) in normal source. |
| `volatile_local_tactic` | warning | Added indented local `volatile` declarations in normal source, which are usually lifetime/register steering tactics unless real hardware or SDK semantics require them. |
| `type_erasing_cast` | warning | Added `(void*)`, `(u8*)`, or `(char*)` casts. |
| `banned_pattern:<id>` | error | Regex detectors loaded from `projects/pkmn-colosseum/knowledge/sources/injectable/banned_patterns/data/banned.jsonl` (env override `REVIEW_LINT_BANNED_DIR`). |
| `resubmission_tombstone` | error | An added hunk whose normalized token-shingle Jaccard similarity to a previously rejected hunk meets the tombstone's threshold (default 0.7; hunks under 12 tokens are never checked). The finding cites the original rejection comment URL. |

Every finding carries a `standard_id` so agent-facing errors cite the
standard the worker already saw in its prompt.

### Moved vs. Invented Data Anchors

The extern ownership analysis separates the accepted case from the rejected
one. A forward declaration of data the TU still defines later in the file,
where the symbol already existed in the base version (a definition moved
within the file — the accepted ftcoll style from colosseum PR #2655), is dropped.
The same shape where the symbol is entirely new in the diff (the rejected
gm_1832 style from PR #2656) becomes a `new_data_anchor` error.

### Moved vs. Invented Residue

For `unrolled_assert` and the hardened rules above, an error finding is
downgraded to a warning when the exact added line already existed verbatim in
the base version of the same file. This keeps moved pre-existing residue visible
without treating it as newly invented gate-blocking code.

### Exit Codes (`--gate`)

- `0`: clean.
- `1`: at least one error finding (hard fail).
- `2`: warnings only.

Without `--gate` the exit code is `0` unless the tool itself fails (`3` for a
missing repo or diff file). Consumers share one invoker,
`apps/server/src/core/validation/qa/scan-diff.ts`: the L2 ship gate in `regression-check`
(fails closed on tool errors and requires zero errors plus zero warnings), the
worker-side L1 lint in `change-validation` (treats warnings as repair targets
but fails open on tool errors), and `pr-preship-review` (per-slice lint
evidence for the adversarial reviewer).
