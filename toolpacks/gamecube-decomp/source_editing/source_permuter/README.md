# Source Permuter Tool Suite

This suite wraps the tool-local source-level permuter. It works on the real C
translation unit text, compiles candidates with the same MWCC rule as the
project build, and scores candidates through objdiff.

APIs:

- `run.py` searches for an improving candidate and returns the best diff.
- `replay.py` replays a saved JSON recipe against the current source.
- `preview_mutation.py` runs one or more tree-sitter mutation steps and returns
  a unified diff without compiling.

The default API behavior is conservative: permutation calls use `--apply never`
unless explicitly overridden outside the worker profile. A worker should treat
the result as a candidate hypothesis, then apply a small understood edit and
verify it with checkdiff/objdiff.
