# System Design Overview

D-Comp Orchestrator is an event-driven coordination system for decompilation
work. A thin runner owns durable state transitions and agent invocation. Pi
agents own reasoning. The board is the shared medium between those two worlds.
An optional guardian process can wrap the decomp system process to handle
operational health events, recovery, and restart without becoming a second
board scheduler.

                             reducer output + next board read
```

The important split is directional: the director reads a compact board and
writes scheduling decisions; workers receive leases and return durable evidence;
the state substrate is the only coordination surface between them.

```

The process health loop is operational, not strategic. It preserves liveness
around the decomp system while the director and workers continue to own
decompilation decisions.

  capabilities, validation, and stall behavior.
- [Worker capabilities](45-worker-capabilities.md) covers the worker tactic
  table, evidence emitted, guardrails, and `melee-assist` absorption map.
- [Knowledge model](50-knowledge-model.md) covers references, workflows, tools,
  decomp resources, and past PR evidence.
- [Score integration and PR handoff](60-score-and-pr-handoff.md) covers the
  validation gate and the boundary between run output and human-facing review.
- [Operator flow and PR tracking](65-operator-flow-and-pr-tracking.md) covers
  the canonical session lifecycle, the pipeline-rail sidebar, and PRs as
  first-class tracked state.
- [Campaign and save points](70-save-points.md) covers the canonical campaign
  timeline, commit-anchored save points, and the where-we-are staleness
  contract.

The original standalone design artifact is preserved as
[../design.html](../design.html). These markdown docs are the maintainable
version of that design, adjusted to the current package layout and terminology.
