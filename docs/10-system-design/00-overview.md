# System Design Overview

D-Comp Orchestrator is an event-driven coordination system for decompilation
work. A thin runner owns durable state transitions, deterministic scheduling,
and agent invocation. Pi agents own bounded target-local or boundary-specific
reasoning. The board is the shared medium between those two worlds.
An optional guardian process can wrap the decomp system process to handle
operational health events, recovery, and restart without becoming a second
board scheduler.

                             refreshed evidence + next board read
```

The important split is directional: the scheduler reads durable board state and
writes reproducible scheduling transitions; workers receive leases and return
durable evidence; the state substrate is the only coordination surface between
them.

```

The process health loop is operational, not strategic. It preserves liveness
around the decomp system while the scheduler and workers continue to own
decompilation decisions.

The original standalone design artifact is preserved as
[../design.html](../design.html). These markdown docs are the maintainable
version of that design, adjusted to the current package layout and terminology.
