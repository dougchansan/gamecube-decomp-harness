# System Design Overview

D-Comp Orchestrator is an event-driven coordination system for decompilation
work. A thin runner owns durable state transitions, deterministic scheduling,
and agent invocation. Pi agents own bounded target-local or boundary-specific
reasoning. The board is the shared medium between those two worlds.
An optional guardian process can wrap the decomp system process to handle
operational health events, recovery, and restart without becoming a second
board scheduler.

                             refreshed evidence + next board read
```

The important split is directional: the scheduler reads durable board state and
writes reproducible scheduling transitions; workers receive target claims and
produce checkpoint evidence; the state substrate is the only coordination
surface between them.

```

The process health loop is operational, not strategic. It preserves liveness
around the decomp system while the scheduler and workers continue to own
decompilation decisions.

  validation gate and the boundary between run output and human-facing review.
- [Operator flow and PR tracking](65-operator-flow-and-pr-tracking.md) covers
  the canonical session lifecycle, the pipeline-rail sidebar, and PRs as
  first-class tracked state.
- [Campaign and save points](70-save-points.md) covers the canonical campaign
  timeline, commit-anchored save points, and the where-we-are staleness
  contract.
- [Project session architecture mockup](75-project-session-architecture.md)

  run-to-PR lifecycle, and multi-page dashboard shape.
