# Core Principles

D-Comp Orchestrator treats a decompilation run as a whole-board reasoning
problem. The scheduler does not camp on one target just because it is
unfinished. It asks where current report and graph evidence make the next useful
move easiest, then applies deterministic epoch policy.

## Sudoku Metaphor

Treat decomp like Sudoku:

- A worker finding a fact does not always finish the file it is holding.
- That fact can still remove bad possibilities from other targets.
- A struct field, source shape, duplicate pattern, naming convention, or
  negative result can make a different target more constrained.
- The scheduler's job is to choose the next admitted square based on the entire
  board, not to tunnel on the last square touched.

In decomp terms, a worker may discover that a guessed source shape cannot be
right, that a duplicate reference has a reusable shape, or that a data owner
blocks several functions. Those outputs become constraints for future target
packets.

## Run Boundary

The run is the unit of progress. A source file, worker, symbol, or claim is not
a PR boundary. A run can target a checkpoint such as `+1.0% matched_code_percent`
or `+5.0% matched_code_percent` and keep integrating verified improvements until
that target is reached or useful evidence runs out.

Full decompilation remains the long-term objective: exact matched code should
keep moving toward `100%`. The run goal is a checkpoint and stop condition, not
a claim that the project is finished. When the checkpoint is reached, the system
should pause the run, emit end-of-run output, and let the operator reallocate
workers, raise the checkpoint, package a PR, or start the next run.

## North-Star Metric

`matched_code_percent` is the north-star metric. It tracks exact matched code
progress and is the v1 target for run goals.

The default acceptance target is reviewable text-section/source code fixes,
code-match blockers, and reusable source-shape facts. Data, literal, symbol, and
split cleanup is secondary unless it is explicitly scoped, required for a code
match, or blocking code-match validation.

`fuzzy_match_percent` is useful telemetry for target selection and local
diagnosis, but it is not the success target. It can be high even when exact
matched code progress remains low.

`complete_code_percent` and linked/unit completeness are useful context, but
they are secondary to exact matched-code movement.

## Former Skill Surfaces

The orchestrator is the top-level run system. Former standalone skill surfaces
move down a layer:

| Former surface | New role inside orchestrator |
| --- | --- |
| `decomp-find` | Board scan, candidate-prior features, linked-blocker awareness, and progress metrics. |
| `melee-decomp` | Worker system prompt and co-located context for one file or symbol: gather evidence, edit source, verify, and stop before guessing. |
| `melee-decomp-sweep` | Last-resort experimental tooling for bounded source-shape experiments, kept out of default prompt context. |
| Run scheduler | Deterministic Sudoku player: admit and route targets from the whole board, explicit epoch policy, claims, cooldowns, and every durable fact. |

## Runtime Principle

The orchestrator itself is not the main reasoning agent. It is a thin stateful
runner that stores facts, target claims, events, prompts, and artifacts. It launches
worker and boundary-review Pi sessions only when durable state says there is
work to do.

Run loops and guardian wrappers are process state machines, not hidden board
agents. The run loop advances the decomp loop from durable events. The guardian
wrapper preserves liveness from process-health events.
