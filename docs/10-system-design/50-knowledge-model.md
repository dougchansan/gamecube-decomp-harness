# Knowledge Model

Runtime knowledge is platform-owned evidence selected or searched by agents. It
is not a Codex skill and it is not a generic pack system. The model separates
access modes: injected context, independently searchable knowledge bases,
code-connected evidence, graph-owned mutable state, and role behavior. Global
knowledge owns reusable source slices and callable tools, the selected project
owns checkout-derived graph facts and run evidence, and agent system prompts
plus routed worker context own role behavior.

## Knowledge Types

| Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Injected context | Compact source slices selected before or during worker boot: global `decomp_standards`, path-scoped `path_facts`, and the maintainer-rejection record `banned_patterns` |
| Searchable knowledge bases | RAG-style corpora that workers query on demand, such as `discord_knowledge` and `powerpc_docs`; these support lexical JSONL lookup and source-local semantic vector lookup after vectorization |
| Code-connected evidence | Source slices that link to files, symbols, PRs, data rows, mirrors, file cards, or rank features |
| Tools | CLI-first helpers that rank targets, gather context, refresh PR data, or analyze last-resort experiment output |
| Code graph | Current-checkout facts about files, object units, functions, match status, and editability |
| Resource graph | Project-selected SQLite graph state linking the code graph with global PR history, source hits, durable lessons, mismatch patterns, editability, and rank features |
| Agent context | Compact worker guidance selected by `packages/agents/src/context/manifest.json`; director scheduling lives in the director system prompt |
| Graph enrichments | Durable learned facts, such as imported legacy shared-agent lessons, curator-produced worker/PR lessons, and derived mismatch-pattern entities, stored as graph-owned artifacts |

## Selection

The director gets scheduling policy directly in its system prompt. Workers get
one compact operating guide by default. Capability hints add focused lookup,
matching, or last-resort sweep context only when the packet needs it. The
one-symbol targeted iteration loop is part of the worker system prompt, not a
separate knowledge workflow.

This keeps the default worker posture careful and evidence-backed. Broader
experimental search and permuter handoff enter only when a packet or capability
route asks for compact last-resort sweep context.

## Naming-Guided Search

Worker search is thoughtful, not random. A worker should use the target symbol,
source path, nearby matched code, headers, splits, symbols, PR history, and
resource tables to infer likely names the original developer would have used:
struct fields, callbacks, states, helper functions, data owners, and sibling
files. Each new fact should narrow the next search query or suggest another
specific file to inspect.

When those evidence-backed names and paths run out, the worker should stop
before hard guessing. The next useful move is to identify what missing fact
would make the search grounded again, queue fact research, or move the worker
slot to a more constrained target.

## Resource Contract

Knowledge material should make agents better at choosing grounded next moves.
It should not swamp prompts with the whole repository or encourage random
sweeps. Useful knowledge names exact sources, explains when it applies, and
preserves provenance so facts can be checked later.

## Maintenance

When adding evidence, decide whether it is injected context, a searchable source,
code-connected evidence, a tool, graph enrichment, durable mismatch-pattern
knowledge, or a past-PR artifact. Raw run output remains evidence until it is
curated into a durable graph record. When
adding behavior, put it beside the agent as context and route it through
`packages/agents/src/context/manifest.json`.

PR and worker learning enters through a maintenance pipeline:

1. PR refresh/sync updates `knowledge/sources/code_context/past_prs/data`.
   Full corpus refresh uses `bun run pr:refresh:all`, which runs 32 fetch
   workers and 32 PR-review workers by default.
2. The PR-review/indexing pass creates missing per-PR postmortems under
   `knowledge/sources/code_context/past_prs/data/prs/pr-NNNN/postmortem`.
3. Source indexers generate source-local `indexes/*.jsonl` files for active
   injected context, searchable documents, CSVs, PDF page text, and external
   mirrors.
4. RAG source vectorizers embed generated document chunks into source-local
   `indexes/vector.sqlite` stores and record the embedding provider, model,
   dimensions, source fingerprint, and chunking policy in
   `indexes/vector_manifest.json`.
5. `kg:tool-indexes` generates local JSONL indexes for callable tool APIs; those
   indexes stay under `tools/<category>/<tool_id>/indexes` and are refreshed
   through the owning tool.
6. Workers persist reports in SQLite and artifact files after the return gate.
7. The knowledge curator reduces worker reports and PR postmortems into
   `knowledge/resource_graph/enrichments/knowledge_curator_updates.jsonl`.
8. Graph rebuild ingests selected project code data, active registered sources,
   legacy/curator enrichments, and derived mismatch-pattern records into the
   selected graph database.
9. `kg:smoke -- --strict` verifies every source has graph chunks and every
   registered tool API is ready.

Workers and PR agents do not directly mutate the canonical graph. They produce
evidence. The curator converts evidence into accepted lessons or proposal-only
source updates, and deterministic graph ingestion owns the final write.

## Banned Patterns

`knowledge/sources/injectable/banned_patterns` is the executable record of
maintainer rejections — the QA ship gate's L4 feedback loop (see
[score and PR handoff](60-score-and-pr-handoff.md)). Once a maintainer rejects
a pattern, the record blocks it mechanically instead of relying on an LLM
remembering:

- `data/banned.jsonl` holds one record per maintainer finding. Each record's
  `detector` is either `agent_exhibit` (fed to the pre-ship review prompt as a
  retrieval exhibit) or `regex` (loaded by `review_lint` at startup as an
  additional deterministic gate rule). New `regex` detectors always require
  human approval before landing — a bad regex blocking all ships is the
  failure mode to avoid.
- `data/tombstones.jsonl` holds fuzzy fingerprints of rejected hunks:
  normalized 4-token shingles compared by Jaccard similarity against each
  hunk's added lines (threshold 0.7 per record, with a 12-token minimum so
  trivial hunks never match). The diff scanner hard-fails any new hunk above
  the threshold, citing the original rejection comment URL, so a rejected
  change can never be resubmitted.
- New candidates enter through `build_pr_postmortems.py
  --extract-banned-patterns`, which writes `disposition: "proposed"` records
  into `data/proposals/`; promotion into `banned.jsonl` is a deliberate
  human/curator action.

Field shapes, loader contracts, and matching constraints live in the source's
`data/schema.md`.

## Worker Packet Evidence

Before a worker starts editing, the runner attaches `knowledge_context` to the
target packet. This precomputed context includes the file card, editability
state, graph resource hits, linked mismatch patterns, PR history, scheduling
signals, and the direct CLI commands the worker can call for follow-up lookup.
Workers may still search individual sources or tools when the packet exposes a
concrete question, but they do not start from a cold prompt.
