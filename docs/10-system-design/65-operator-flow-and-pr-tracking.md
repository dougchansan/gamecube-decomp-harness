# Operator Flow And PR Tracking

The dashboard's left rail should read as the lifecycle itself: every control
belongs to a numbered stage, the current stage is obvious, and PRs are
first-class tracked objects rather than a markdown artifact the operator goes
hunting for. This doc records the canonical flow and the agreed UI direction
(pipeline rail, 2026-06-11); the PR tracker is design-direction until built.

## The Canonical Lifecycle

One session, start to finish:

1. **Start a run** — sync everything down (pull upstream, intake merged PRs,
   rebuild knowledge), rebuild the report so the baseline and progress
   numbers are current.
2. **Queue runs** — workers lease targets with whatever pool/thinking
   configuration was chosen.
3. **Epoch boundary** — when the queue drains, the epoch cycle commits,
   rebuilds the report, and the confirmed set updates. Confirmation happens
   *here*, continuously, not only at the end.
4. **Salvage, don't discard** — tentative items that didn't survive are
   wiped from the board; regressions and QA failures become improvements or
   needs_rework and are requeued at repair priority. Nothing verified is
   thrown away; it is re-aimed.
5. **Accumulate** — the loop continues, building confirmed and tentative
   items until the operator decides there is enough to ship.
6. **Prepare handoff** — stop intake (drain or force stop) and run the ship
   pipeline. This is the **hard save point that ends the session**: it does
   everything itself — checkpoint (there is no manual checkpoint button;
   checkpoints happen at epoch drains and here), QA, plan, ship-set
   verification, one automatic reconcile fix loop if the ship set is
   blocked, the post-survivor replan, seeding the PR board, and a `ship`
   save point. Because the epoch cycle already validated continuously, the
   end-of-run QA is a *confirmation* pass, not the place correctness is
   established: everything it sees as confirmed is already known to work.
   (Direction: keep moving robustness into the epoch/checkpoint loop so
   prepare stays cheap.)
7. **Plan PRs** — the split plan becomes a visible PR list: which PRs exist,
   what files each carries, which are ready to open.
8. **Open and track PRs** — branches pushed, PRs opened, and from then on
   the system tracks each PR's status (draft / open / changes requested /
   merged / closed), whether it is ours, comment and CI state, and its file
   manifest.
9. **New session** — restart the baseline. Unshipped improvements stay on
   the local branch (only confirmed matches ever ship); the next session
   measures against the new baseline with that carry-forward intact.

Rules the rail must keep:

- Every stage is always visible with a one-line verdict; nothing important
  hides behind the current phase.
- Each stage owns its buttons. A button never appears outside its stage, and
  the single recommended next action is highlighted (same recommendation
  logic the Actions panel uses today).
- Stage detail rows reuse the grouped Status semantics (Run / Sync / PR
  readiness) that already exist; the rail is a reorganization, not a new
  data source — except stage 4.
- Secondary controls (run sizing, stepwise handoff buttons, process panel)
  collapse into per-stage disclosures.

## PR Tracking Model (stage 4)

A PR record marries a split-plan slice to a GitHub PR and outlives both:

- **Identity**: slice id (`ft`, `gm`, …), branch name, title, file manifest
  (pathspecs from the surviving match lane).
- **Lifecycle status**: `planned` → `branch_pushed` → `draft` → `open` →
  `changes_requested` → `merged` / `closed`. Planned slices come from the
  latest ship-filtered split plan; everything after comes from `gh`.
- **GitHub state**: PR number/URL, ours vs upstream-author, review decision,
  unresolved comment count, CI verdict, base/head SHAs.
- **Persistence**: records live in orchestrator state (not just the plan
  artifact) so a PR opened in one session is still tracked in the next, and
  `Sync Merged PRs` can mark records merged and trigger intake.

Each board row expands to its branch, GitHub link, and file manifest. A
`planned` row carries the **Open draft PR** button (`/api/prs/open`): the
slice is re-verified alone against the cached baseline worktree (apply →
incremental build → regression report → upstream `check-issues` lint →
reset), then a branch is cut from the base SHA, the slice's subset of
`ship_set.patch` is committed, pushed to the `fork` remote, and opened as a
**draft** on upstream with a generated body (summary, file list,
verification). Draft means nothing pings maintainers until the operator
reviews the body and un-drafts. A slice that regresses in isolation fails
with a stacking hint instead of publishing; a slice that fails the lint
(the same `ghcr.io/doldecomp/melee/check-issues` container CI runs, so
things like `-Wself-assign` permuter slop or conflicting prototypes) fails
before pushing instead of failing on the PR. Ship-set verification runs the
same lint each survivor round and drops offending files to rework. If
docker is unavailable the lint is skipped with a warning and CI remains the
backstop.
**Open All Drafts** (`/api/prs/open-all`) runs the same pipeline for every
planned slice sequentially — support/shared slices first, since subsystem
slices may only build on top of them — and a failed slice is recorded and
skipped rather than stranding the rest. Upstream PRs by other authors appear
as a count, because they gate when a sync is worthwhile.
