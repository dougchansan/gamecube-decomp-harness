# Foundation: D-Comp Orchestrator

D-Comp Orchestrator coordinates Colosseum decompilation work across a durable board
of targets, facts, leases, and agent reports. It is not a replacement for the
Colosseum toolchain. It is the runtime that decides which bounded unit of work is
worth attempting next, records what happened, and keeps useful evidence moving
through the run.

## North Star

A deterministic run scheduler understands the whole board. It admits bounded
target packets to workers, then sleeps until durable state changes. Workers
research, edit, verify, and report inside explicit leases. The system improves
because each worker produces durable evidence, not because agents chat with each
other or mutate source without accountability.

The core metaphor is Sudoku: a worker may discover a fact or negative result
that does not finish its current target, but still constrains the board enough
to make a different target the right next move.

The runtime can also be wrapped by a guardian process for long-running
development runs. That guardian watches system health events, records incidents,
recovers failed or expired leases, and restarts the decomp system process. It
does not become a second scheduler.

## Principles

- Board-level admission and routing belong to the scheduler.
- The scheduler chooses the next most constrained useful square through
  deterministic epoch policy; it does not camp on one unfinished file.
- Source research, local edits, validation, and blocker discovery belong to
  workers.
- Every handoff is durable: events, reports, facts, leases, prompts, and
  artifacts survive process exits.
- Long-running process health belongs to a guardian wrapper, not hidden
  always-on agent memory.
- Workers pursue evidence-backed hypotheses. Experimental search is bounded and
  opt-in.
- Write safety is a first-class runtime concern, enforced by leases and file
  locks.
- PR packaging is separate from the worker loop. A run should produce coherent
  improvement bundles, not one PR per worker or target.

## Boundaries

The orchestrator does not own the compiler, objdiff, build system, or final PR
review. It wraps those tools and records their evidence. It also does not try to
maintain hidden, always-on agent memory. The board, not a long-lived chat
thread, is the source of truth.

Generated state belongs under an explicit state directory. The orchestrator is
the platform repo, and a selected project supplies the checkout root, state
directory, graph database, process name, and local defaults. Runtime artifacts,
SQLite files, prompts, and reports belong under the selected project's state
directory unless an operator intentionally uses raw path overrides.

## Current Maturity

The package has a production-shaped vertical slice: it can initialize a run,
queue fixture targets, run a dry-run scheduler tick, lease one worker target,
write reports, recover interrupted leases, run a global regression-check
wrapper, run the deterministic run loop, and run a guardian wrapper around that
loop. The run loop handles durable events with the scheduler, fills worker slots
from queued work, and rests when the board is quiet. The guardian wrapper wakes on
process-health incidents and restarts the decomp system process when policy
allows. PR refresh and end-to-end score integration remain explicit operator
steps.
