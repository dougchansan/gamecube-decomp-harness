# CLI: Overview

The CLI is split into command modules under `apps/cli/src/cli/commands/`.
The binary entry point stays thin: it parses arguments, applies defaults, and
dispatches to the selected command.

Global parsing can resolve a configured project before command dispatch.
`--project <id>` selects `projects/<id>/project.json`, applies ignored
`projects/<id>/local.project.json` when present, then applies explicit
`--repo-root`, `--state-dir`, and command-level `--graph-db` overrides. Project
mode carries the resolved project id, checkout root, state directory, graph
database, descriptor path, and local override path through CLI commands. Raw
path mode remains available when `--project` is omitted.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `init-run` | Creates run state, stores the run checkpoint goal, loads board data, queues initial candidate targets, and writes the initial board snapshot. |
| `tick` | Handles one unhandled wake event by running one director cycle. |
| `worker` | Leases one queued target, runs worker/repair sessions, gates returns on runner-owned post-return validation, writes report artifacts, releases the lease, and emits a wake event. |
| `trigger-agent` | Resting supervisor loop that wakes the director on events, starts workers up to `desired_workers` or `--max-workers`, and sleeps when the board is quiet. |
| `bootstrap` | Alias for `trigger-agent`. |
| `babysit` | Guardian wrapper that launches the decomp system command, captures process-health incidents, recovers failed or expired leases, and restarts according to policy. |
| `checkpoint-run` | Harvests a drained run into PR-candidate exact matches and carry-forward items. |
| `recover-leases` | Converts interrupted or expired active leases into durable stalled reports after operator confirmation. |
| `epoch-run` | Runs one epoch checkpoint cycle by hand: commits validated work (excluding active-lease files), rebuilds the full report in the persistent epoch worktree, records an `epoch` save point, and requeues regression repairs. `--no-requeue` plans repairs without touching the queue. |
| `regression-check` | Wraps the repo's global saved-baseline regression gate, runs the QA ship gate (`review_lint` diff scan vs `--qa-base`, fail-closed, bypass only via `--skip-qa-gate`), and writes run artifacts. |
| `pr-split-plan` | Plans review-sized PR slices from the current branch/worktree by grouping changed files by Melee subsystem or top-level directory. |
| `pr-preship-review` | Runs the pr-review agent in adversarial pre-ship mode over planned PR slices (`--plan` from saved `pr-split-plan --json` output, `--all` or `--slice <id>`); any `reject` finding or infrastructure failure exits 1 and blocks handoff. Artifacts land under `state_dir/preship_reviews/<run-id>/<slice-id>/`. |
| `reconcile` | Runs the reconcile Pi agent. `--mode ship-validate` fixes QA-gate regressions before PR handoff; `--mode sync-merge` resolves merge conflicts, duplicate matches, and build errors after an upstream sync. `--attempt-budget` bounds fix cycles; artifacts land under `state_dir/reconcile/<timestamp>/`. |
| `save-point` | Records a campaign save point: commits the dirty worktree (never staging `decomp-orchestrator/` or the state dir), copies `report.json`/`report_changes.json` plus a board snapshot under `state_dir/save_points/<timestamp>/`, and inserts the row with commit/base SHAs and `matched_code_percent`. `--list` prints recent save points. |
| `kg-sources` | Lists active knowledge source sections and external tool integrations. |
| `kg-status` | Prints graph database path, source/tool registry summaries, and graph record counts. |
| `kg-curate` | Reduces worker reports and PR postmortems into graph-owned curator enrichment records. |
| `kg-maintain` | Runs pending PR postmortem indexing, curator reduction, optional curator-agent proposal review, and graph rebuild. |
| `kg-rebuild-graph` | Rebuilds the v1 SQLite graph from selected active sources and graph-owned enrichments. |
| `kg-search` | Searches indexed graph chunks with optional source filtering. |
| `kg-file-card` | Prints file graph context, editability, PR history, resource hits, and scheduling signals for one source path. |
| `kg-rank-features` | Shows graph-derived ranking features for current board candidates. |
| `status` | Prints run, queue, lease, event, and report summary data. |

## Boundaries

The CLI keeps the single-step commands for debuggability, exposes
`trigger-agent` / `bootstrap` for autonomous decomp-system runs, and exposes
`babysit` as the outer guardian process for long-running development sessions.

Project resolution is a global CLI concern, not a command-local convention.
Commands consume `globals.repoRoot`, `globals.stateDir`, optional
`globals.graphDbPath`, and optional project metadata from the parser. State
metadata, agent prompts, resource maps, process command construction, and
knowledge graph commands can therefore share one selected project identity.

The resolver precedence is explicit override, then ignored local project
override, then tracked project descriptor, then built-in defaults. Relative
descriptor and local override paths resolve from the project directory; explicit
CLI paths resolve from the invoking working directory. Project descriptors may
also provide validation defaults, dashboard defaults, PR split defaults,
`baseRef`, `processName`, and `localEnv`.

The trigger-agent is deliberately not a Pi agent. It is a thin evented loop over
durable SQLite state: wake the director for unhandled events, start worker
sessions for open slots, then rest until state changes. The babysit command is
also not a Pi agent. It wraps the decomp system process, sleeps while that
process runs, wakes on process exit or worker-process error, writes guardian
artifacts under `state_dir/guardian/`, runs `recover-leases` when appropriate,
and restarts the child when policy allows.

## Worker Post-Return Gate

`worker` captures the write-set diff before the first worker attempt. When the
agent returns, the runner evaluates the structured `local_regression_check`,
checks that validation artifacts exist, verifies edited paths stay inside the
lease, compares the post-attempt write-set diff against the pre-worker diff,
and optionally runs `--post-return-check-command` for accepted
`progress`/`score_candidate` reports.

If the post-return gate fails, the lease remains held and the runner sends a
`repair_request` back to the worker. `--repair-attempts` controls how many
repair turns are allowed before the runner records a stalled report. The
optional command hook runs from the repo root and supports placeholders:
`{repo_root}`, `{state_dir}`, `{worker_log_dir}`, `{lease_id}`,
`{source_path}`, `{unit}`, `{symbol}`, and `{write_set}`.

`--worker-thinking-level` lets the trigger actor launch worker Pi sessions with
a different thinking level from the director. For example, the director can stay
on the global default while workers run with `--worker-thinking-level low`.

The trigger actor also owns queue shape, and by default runs the epoch cycle:
refill fills the queue to `--queue-target-size` in one batch, workers drain it
with no top-ups, and when queued work hits zero the epoch pipeline runs while
in-flight workers finish. The pipeline commits validated work (excluding files
under active leases), checks that commit out into a persistent worktree at
`<state-dir>/epoch_worktree`, runs `--epoch-configure-command` plus the full
report build there, publishes the fresh `report.json`/`report_changes.json`
back to the live repo for board scoring, advances the worktree baseline so the
next epoch diffs epoch-over-epoch, records an `epoch` save point with measures,
regression counts, and a `qa_gate` payload (the `review_lint` scan of the
epoch diff — observability for the dashboard only; the hard stop is the L2
gate in `regression-check`), requeues regressed functions as priority repair
targets, and finally refills the next batch from the re-scored board. Epoch
failures emit `epoch_cycle_error` and back off `--epoch-retry-ms`; regressions
above `--epoch-regression-pause-threshold` emit `epoch_regression_pause` and
withhold the refill. `--no-epoch-cycle` restores the legacy continuous mode
described further below.

Queue size and board scan width are separate. `--candidate-limit` remains the
initial seed size and compatibility pool size. `--queue-target-size` is the
epoch batch size (and in legacy mode, the level continuous refill maintains).
`--candidate-window` controls the initial ranked board scan width used to find
fresh work beyond the current pool. If that window is exhausted, deterministic
refill expands the scan until it restores the pool target or reaches the end of
the ranked board.

In both modes the trigger periodically rereads the graph-ranked board and
refreshes priorities for queued-but-not-leased targets inside the scan window.
Graph maintenance can therefore move newly informative targets upward without
waiting for the old queue to drain completely. In epoch mode this refresh is
priority-only and never inserts targets mid-batch.

In legacy continuous mode (`--no-epoch-cycle`) the trigger instead tops the
queue back up toward the target on every pass and writes a prioritized
`pool_below_target` event when deterministic refill is not enough and capacity
is becoming inefficient. The CLI defaults wake the director when total queued
work falls to 25% of `--queue-target-size`, when unlocked distinct-file work
falls below `--max-workers`, when queued work is blocked by active file locks,
or when a long-tail drain persists for five minutes. The dashboard uses a
stricter preset policy: ready queue is always `4 * workers`, and
`--queue-low-watermark` is always `workers`, so a 16-worker dashboard run
keeps a 64-target queue and asks for fresh priority work when 16 queued
targets remain. In epoch mode those watermark replans are suppressed — a
draining queue is the intended shape — and `pool_below_target` is emitted only
when a post-rebuild refill finds no fresh board work. Operators using the CLI
directly can tune this with:

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--no-epoch-cycle` | Restore continuous queue top-up and watermark-driven replan events. |
| `--epoch-worktree <path>` | Persistent checkpoint worktree; default `<state-dir>/epoch_worktree`. |
| `--epoch-configure-command <cmd>` | Shell command run in the worktree before each report build; default `python configure.py --require-protos`. |
| `--epoch-link-paths <a,b>` | Untracked build inputs symlinked from the live repo into the worktree; default `orig`. |
| `--epoch-regression-pause-threshold <n>` | Pause (no refill) when more than `n` report rows regress in one epoch; default 12. |
| `--epoch-regression-requeue-limit <n>` | Max regressed functions requeued as priority repairs per epoch; default 32. |
| `--epoch-retry-ms <n>` | Backoff after an epoch failure, pause, or exhausted board; default 600000. |
| `--candidate-limit <n>` | Initial seed size and compatibility pool size; default is `max(32, max_workers * 2)`. |
| `--queue-target-size <n>` | Maintain at least this many queued targets, subject to available fresh board candidates; default is `max(candidate_limit, max_workers * 2)`. |
| `--candidate-window <n>` | Initial number of ranked board candidates scanned for director context and deterministic refill; refill expands this when the window is exhausted. |
| `--graph-db <path>` | Knowledge graph used for board ranking and worker file-card context; defaults to the selected project's graph DB, or `knowledge/resource_graph/graph.sqlite` without a project. |
| `--queue-refresh-interval-ms <n>` | Refresh queued target priorities from the latest graph-ranked board at this interval; default is 60000. |
| `--queue-low-watermark <n>` | Wake when total queued work is at or below `n` while workers are active. |
| `--schedulable-low-watermark <n>` | Wake when unlocked distinct-file work is at or below `n` while the run is underfilled. |
| `--active-low-watermark <n>` | Active-worker threshold for long-tail detection; default is 75% of `--max-workers`. |
| `--long-tail-replan-ms <n>` | Wake after underfilled long-tail state persists for `n` ms. |
| `--replan-interval-ms <n>` | Optional periodic director wake while workers are active; default `0` disables it. |
| `--replan-cooldown-ms <n>` | Minimum delay between trigger-produced replan events. |
| `--no-blocked-queue-replan` | Disable replans caused only by queued work blocked behind file locks. |

The babysit wrapper forwards these trigger flags to its child `bootstrap` or
`trigger-agent` command.

## Regression Check

`regression-check` wraps the saved-baseline `ninja changes_all` flow, captures
stdout/stderr, parses `build/GALE01/report_changes.json`, writes
`summary.json`, and generates a PR-style Markdown report through
`packages/core/src/objdiff/report.ts`. The regression gate fails when Ninja returns nonzero,
the report cannot be parsed, or the report contains broken matches, fuzzy
regressions, or metric regressions.

The QA ship gate (L2) runs in the same command. After the build step,
`regression-check` invokes the `review_lint` diff scanner
(`tools/source_editing/review_lint/api/scan_diff.py`) against the merge-base
with `--qa-base` (default: the project's `baseRef`, else `origin/master`) and
folds the result into the verdict:
`passed = regressionGatePassed && !promotionBlocked && qaGatePassed`. The
summary gains `qaGateExitCode`, `qaGateSkipped`, `qaFindings`, `qaCounts`, and
`qaScanPath`; raw scanner output lands beside it as `qa_scan.json` and
`qa_scan.txt`. The gate fails closed — a scanner that cannot run blocks the
handoff — and a failure hint lists the violating rules at `file:line`, with
each finding citing the standard it violates. The only bypass is an explicit
`--skip-qa-gate`, for emergencies.

The same report evaluates PR promotion separately from regression cleanliness.
Default promotion evidence requires no regressions plus an exact new match or
matched code/data byte movement; fuzzy-only improvements are recorded as
`local_only` evidence because match percent alone can be misleading. Use
`--require-pr-promotion` for final maintainer-facing handoff, and tune
`--promotion-min-*` thresholds only when an operator deliberately wants a higher
or broader promotion policy.

## Run Checkpoint

`checkpoint-run` is the operator bridge between a drained run and PR packaging.
It reads worker reports for the selected run, writes checkpoint artifacts under
`state_dir/runs/<run_id>/checkpoints/<timestamp>/`, and persists the split to
`run_checkpoints` and `checkpoint_items`.

The checkpoint classifies exact-match `progress` or `score_candidate` reports
as `pr_candidate`. Clean non-exact progress is evaluated against the project's
improvement promotion floors (`pr.improvementMinGainPoints`, default 2.0
match-percent points, and `pr.improvementMinMatchedBytes`, default 64 estimated
matched bytes from function size × gain): improvements that clear both floors
become `improvement_candidate` and ship in a separate improvement PR lane,
while sub-floor progress becomes `deferred_patch`. `needs_fact`,
`stalled_no_useful_guess`, and `needs_rework` reports stay visible as
carry-forward evidence. The generated `pr_candidates.md` lists both lanes
(match candidates first, then improvement candidates with their gain and byte
evidence) and is the source list for PR packaging, while `carry_forward.md` is
the ledger of local work that should not be forgotten after the baseline or
next run is reset.

The dashboard Fresh Run action checkpoints the current run before resetting the
report baseline by default. Disable that only when intentionally discarding or
manually managing the previous run handoff.

The dashboard PR Handoff panel also exposes `Checkpoint` as a direct action.
That UI path calls the same `createRunCheckpoint` handoff logic as
`checkpoint-run` and refuses active leases unless the run has been drained or
the leases have been recovered.

## PR Split Planning

`pr-split-plan` is the operator handoff command for turning a large accepted
change bundle into smaller review units. It reads `git diff --name-status
<base-ref>...HEAD` and dirty worktree status from `--repo-root`, merges those
paths, and groups them into slices.

The default `--group-mode melee-subsystem` treats any path containing
`melee/<subsystem>` as part of that subsystem, so source, headers, and assembly
for `it`, `gm`, `cm`, `ft`, and adjacent directories stay together. Support
roots such as `sysdolphin`, `Runtime`, `MSL`, and `MetroTRK` become their own
slices, while cross-cutting root/config files become shared slices. Use
`--group-mode top-dir` for a simpler first-directory split.

Passing `--checkpoint <checkpoint.json>` (the dashboard does this
automatically using the latest run checkpoint) splits each subsystem slice
into PR lanes: a match slice carrying `pr_candidate` files plus supporting
files the matches need to build, and an improvement slice
(`improve-<subsystem>` branch, `(fuzzy improvements)` title) carrying
`improvement_candidate` files. Improvement slices warn that they need
NONMATCHING framing and a lower review priority; match slices warn when a file
also carries fuzzy improvements in other functions. `--max-files-per-pr` is a
hard ceiling for slice refinement, not a packing target.

Each slice includes a suggested branch name, PR title, pathspec list, patch
workflow, isolation-check workflow, and unverified independence disposition.
The disposition is conservative metadata:

| Disposition | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `independent` | Looks source/header-scoped to one Melee subsystem and can become an independent PR only after the isolation check passes. |
| `shared-prep` | Touches build/config/generated/root/support-library files or other shared surfaces that should land first or be stacked intentionally. |
| `stacked` | Looks subsystem-adjacent but may depend on shared declarations, renames, deletes, or other nonlocal effects. |
| `needs-merge` | The split is probably artificial for review; keep it together or manually redesign the slice. |

The isolation workflow applies one slice to a fresh worktree at `--base-ref` and
runs `--slice-check-command`, which defaults to `python configure.py
--require-protos && ninja changes_all`. Worktree and untracked files are
included by default so the operator can see unfinished local changes, but the
command warns that generated patch commands only replay committed `HEAD`
changes. Use `--committed-only` after committing the source bundle,
`--worktree-only` for a local staging preview, `--no-untracked` to suppress
untracked paths, `--json` for automation, or `--output <path>` to save the
rendered plan.

## Dashboard Handoff Controls

The UI server wraps the same operator commands for PR preparation:

| UI Action | Underlying behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `Pause Intake` | Drains the managed process and marks the run `paused`, which prevents `start`, `tick`, `worker`, and `trigger-agent` scheduling until the run is resumed. |
| `Checkpoint` | Runs the checkpoint handoff logic and writes checkpoint artifacts under the run state directory. |
| `Run QA` | Runs `regression-check` with `--require-pr-promotion` enabled by default, plus `--promotion-min-unmatched-improvement-bytes` from the project's improvement byte floor so improvement-only handoffs can still promote. |
| `Plan PRs` | Runs `pr-split-plan` with the selected base ref, group mode, branch prefix, title prefix, worktree/untracked options, and the latest checkpoint for match/improvement lane splitting. |
| `Prepare` | Runs pause, checkpoint, QA, and split planning in sequence; split planning runs only after QA passes. |

The UI stores split-plan artifacts under
`state_dir/pr_handoff/<run_id>/split_plans/<timestamp>/`. Regression-check
artifacts stay under `state_dir/regression_checks/<run_id>/<timestamp>/`, and
checkpoint artifacts stay under
`state_dir/runs/<run_id>/checkpoints/<timestamp>/`.

## Knowledge Maintenance

`trigger-agent` can run `kg-maintain` in the background. Live runs default to a
five-minute maintenance interval; dry-run agents default to disabled. Use
`--no-knowledge-maintenance` to disable it, or
`--knowledge-maintenance-interval-ms <n>` to tune it.

Maintenance does not require the main loop to inspect individual PRs. The PR
postmortem command uses pending-only discovery to find PRs in the active corpus
that do not have `postmortem/postmortem.json` yet. Live trigger maintenance queues up to
eight pending PRs per interval through the PR-review agent by default; use
`--no-run-pr-agent` to keep the background pass deterministic or `--pr-limit`
to tune the batch. Direct `kg-maintain` remains deterministic unless
`--run-pr-agent` is passed. The knowledge curator then rewrites graph-owned
worker/PR lessons and proposal-only source updates before the graph rebuild.

`init-run --goal-kind matched_code_percent --goal-value <percent>` records the
checkpoint for this run. The checkpoint is a pause/handoff threshold for the
current batch, not the final decompilation objective. The long-term project
target remains `100%` matched code.
