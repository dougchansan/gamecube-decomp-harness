# Design Source

The original standalone design doc remains at
`decomp-orchestrator/decomp-orchestrator-design.html`.

An exact package-local copy is preserved at [../../design.html](../../design.html)
so the docs folder contains the visual HTML artifact as well as the markdown
documentation set.

## Markdown Conversion Map

## Preservation Rule

Do not delete or rewrite the preserved HTML as part of routine markdown doc
maintenance. Update markdown docs as the live package design evolves. Refresh
the HTML copy only when intentionally replacing the visual design artifact.

For an explicit checklist, see the
[design coverage audit](40-design-coverage.md).
