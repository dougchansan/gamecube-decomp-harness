# Agents: Overview

Agent implementation is centralized under `packages/agents/src/`. Each role owns its
prompt builder, templates, schema or output parsing, and role-specific helpers.
Shared Pi invocation, artifact writing, prompt rendering, and JSON-output
salvage live in the runtime slice.

Trigger and guardian process actors are not implemented in `packages/agents/src/`
because they are not Pi agent roles. They live in the CLI/runtime command
surface and operate on process events and durable state.

## Section Scope

### What This Section Owns

- The central agent registry.
- Role prompt builders and templates.
- Output parsing and agent response contracts.
- Shared runtime integration with dry-run and live Pi sessions.

### What This Section Does Not Own

- SQLite state transitions after a parsed response.
- Trigger loops, guardian wrappers, restart policy, and lease-recovery command
  orchestration.
- Board target ranking logic.
- Knowledge file contents, except for selecting and rendering them into prompts.

## Reconcile Agent

`packages/agents/src/reconcile/` defines the operator-triggered reconcile agent
with two modes. `ship-validate` consumes the latest `regression-check` summary
and fixes broken matches, fuzzy regressions, and metric regressions until the
QA gate is clean or its attempt budget escalates. `sync-merge` runs after an
upstream pull/intake: it resolves merge conflicts, prefers upstream for
duplicate matches (recording the local attempt as a carry-forward lesson), and
fixes build errors against the new baseline. The CLI exposes it as the
`reconcile` command; the dashboard exposes it via `POST /api/pr/reconcile`.
Both refuse to run while the run status is `active`.
