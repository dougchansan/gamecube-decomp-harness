# Worker Tool Suites

Callable decomp tools are resolved through a toolpack/project binding runtime.
Reusable GameCube decomp tool contracts, default Python APIs, runners, recipes,
and shared helper modules live in `toolpacks/gamecube-decomp`. A project
selects that pack from `projects/<id>/project.json` and owns its bindings,
stable generated tool data, and mutable worktree output.

`apps/server` owns the resolver and agent-facing wrappers only. It does not own
or mirror a server-local tool resource tree; callable tool definitions,
implementations, runner scripts, and tests belong to the toolpack selected by
the project descriptor.

Knowledge sources and tools are separate surfaces. Knowledge sources store
searchable or injectable facts. Tools execute lookup, validation, compiler,
source-editing, and conversion operations against a resolved project/worktree
context.

## Ownership

| Surface | Path | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Toolpack descriptor | `toolpacks/gamecube-decomp/toolpack.json` | Reusable GameCube decomp pack metadata. |
| Tool registry | `toolpacks/gamecube-decomp/registry.json` | Stable tool ids, paths, categories, usage metadata. |
| Tool slices | `toolpacks/gamecube-decomp/<category>/<tool_id>` | Default APIs, runners, descriptors, tests, and docs. |
| Shared helper code | `toolpacks/gamecube-decomp/_shared` | Toolpack-level Python support helpers. |
| Shared implementation modules | `toolpacks/gamecube-decomp/_impl/gamecube` | Toolpack-owned implementation helpers used by public tool APIs. |
| Project binding root | `projects/<id>/tool-bindings/<tool_id>.json` | Enablement, overrides, and per-project roots. |
| Shared project tool data | `projects/<id>/shared/tool-data/<tool_id>` | Stable indexes/cache tied to a project binary or base checkout. |
| Worktree tool cache | `projects/<id>/worktrees/<worktree_id>/tool-cache/<tool_id>` | Mutable validation, compiler, editing, and candidate output for one active worktree. |

## Runtime

`apps/server/src/core/tools/resolver.ts` merges:

- the enabled toolpack from `projects/<id>/project.json`;
- the tool's registry entry;
- the project binding file;
- optional project override roots;
- the runtime project and worktree context.

The merged tool context contains the API path, tool root, project repo root,
project state dir, shared data root, worktree cache root, implementation root,
and a command environment. Agent wrappers call tools by stable ids such as
`checkdiff`, `ghidra`, and `review_lint`; they do not hardcode physical script
paths.

When `projects/<id>/state/tools/wibo` exists, the resolver exports it to tool
APIs as `MWCC_WIBO`. Toolpack helpers also auto-discover the same state install
from worker worktree paths. This makes wibo the preferred MWCC process runner
for checkdiff, direct compile, source permutation, and mwcc debug operations.
Wine remains a fallback for hosts or debug modes where wibo is unavailable or a
specific tool path requests it.

## Worker Tool Concurrency

Compile-heavy tool APIs queue through epoch/worktree-scoped slot directories
instead of launching unbounded MWCC processes from every active worker. The
shared helper `toolpacks/gamecube-decomp/_shared/toolpack_runtime.py` wraps
tool-local API commands in `worker_tool_slot`.

Default tool slot limits:

| Operation family | Default concurrent slots |
| --- | --- |
| `source_permuter:run`, `source_permuter:replay` | 1 |
| `checkdiff:*` | 12 |
| `m2c_decomp:*` | 8 |
| `mwcc_debug:*` | 2 |
| Other tool APIs | 16 |

Source-permuter run/replay calls use a fail-fast policy: if another
source-permuter call is active, the API returns `queue_busy` instead of waiting
behind it. The outer source-permuter slot is separate from the permuter's
internal worker count; `ORCH_SOURCE_PERMUTER_MAX_JOBS` caps requested internal
jobs and defaults to `1`.

Operators can tune the pool with environment variables:

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `ORCH_TOOL_CONCURRENCY_<TOOL>` | Per-tool override, where `<TOOL>` is the uppercase operation prefix such as `CHECKDIFF`, `SOURCE_PERMUTER`, or `MWCC_DEBUG`. |
| `ORCH_WORKER_TOOL_CONCURRENCY_<TOOL>` | Worker-specific per-tool override. |
| `ORCH_WORKER_TOOL_CONCURRENCY` | Shared default for all worker tool pools without a per-tool override. |
| `ORCH_TOOL_QUEUE_DISABLED` / `ORCH_WORKER_TOOL_QUEUE_DISABLED` | Disable queueing for diagnosis only. |

Runner-owned validation has a separate shared compile pool for `ninja` commands
executed during worker checkpoint validation and MWCC/wibo direct compile
helpers. Set `ORCH_WORKER_COMPILE_CONCURRENCY` to tune it, or
`ORCH_WORKER_NINJA_CONCURRENCY` as a compatibility fallback; the default is
`12`. The worker count can therefore be higher than the number of simultaneous
local compiles.

## Suite Roles

| Tool | Role | Default use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `checkdiff` | Focused compile/checkdiff validation. | Attempt evaluation feedback. |
| `review_lint` | Source review anti-pattern scan. | Attempt evaluation feedback and QA gates. |
| `include_fixer` | Missing include preview. | Conditional feedback after declaration diagnostics. |
| `objdiff_score` | Candidate object scoring. | Conditional feedback when a candidate object exists. |
| `mwcc_debug` | Compiler stack/regflow/inline diagnosis. | Conditional feedback after shape-specific validation symptoms. |
| `ghidra` | Binary symbol/address lookup. | On-demand research. |
| `opseq` | Similar function lookup. | On-demand research before inventing source shape. |
| `mismatch_db` | Known mismatch tactic lookup. | On-demand after first mismatch evidence. |
| `m2c_decomp` | Control-flow scaffold generation. | On-demand for understanding asm only. |
| `type_oracle` | Expression type lookup. | On-demand before type-sensitive rewrites. |
| `source_permuter` | Source-shape search and preview. | On-demand; worker defaults are non-mutating. |
| `struct_infer` | Pointer-register layout inference. | On-demand when offsets need grounding. |
| `item_state_table` | Item state table conversion preview. | On-demand for asm data labels. |

## Agent Entry Points

First-class agent tools live under `apps/server/src/core/tools`.
`runtime/` contains tool construction, command execution helpers, result
formatting, and telemetry. `profiles/` contains role-level tool bundles.
`wrappers/knowledge/` adapts project knowledge sources such as code graph,
past PRs, path facts, standards, and external reference sources into Pi tools.
`wrappers/capabilities/` adapts callable decomp capabilities backed by the
enabled toolpack into specific affordances such as `ghidra_lookup`,
`checkdiff_run`, and `source_permuter_run`.

## Maintenance

`bun run kg:sources` lists active knowledge sources and registered tools.
`bun run kg:smoke -- --project melee --strict` checks graph source readiness and
tool readiness. The strict smoke also requires local indexed source data and
live runner artifacts, so a resolver-valid setup can still fail strict smoke
when generated project data is stale or absent.

Operator refresh commands use the toolpack paths:

- `python3 toolpacks/gamecube-decomp/build_tool_indexes.py --repo-root <repo_root>`
- `python3 toolpacks/gamecube-decomp/research/ghidra/runners/run_headless_probe.py --repo-root <repo_root>`
- `python3 toolpacks/gamecube-decomp/research/opseq/runners/extract_opcode_sequences.py --repo-root <repo_root>`
- `python3 toolpacks/gamecube-decomp/research/mismatch_db/runners/analyze_objdiff_mismatches.py --repo-root <repo_root>`
- `python3 toolpacks/gamecube-decomp/compiler/mwcc_debug/runners/probe_mwcc_compiler.py --repo-root <repo_root>`

Workers usually call resolver-backed Pi tools or suite APIs, not runners.
Runners and generated data are operator maintenance surfaces.
