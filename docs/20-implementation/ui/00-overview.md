# UI: Overview

The UI is the operator dashboard for live runs. It combines a Bun HTTP server
with a React app so an operator can inspect progress, manage the long-running
process, checkpoint runs, and prepare PR handoff artifacts without switching to
the shell.

## Server

`apps/dashboard-server/src/server.ts` serves built static assets from
`apps/dashboard/dist/` and exposes JSON endpoints under `/api/`.
`ORCH_UI_PORT` selects the port, defaulting to `8787`. The module exports a
fetch handler for non-listening validation and starts Bun only when run as the
server entrypoint.

The server keeps a small in-process process record for the managed babysit
process and also reads saved process files from
`state_dir/ui-processes/*.json`. This lets the dashboard reconnect to a saved
process record even after a browser refresh or UI server restart. Saved process
records include the selected project summary, repo root, state directory, graph
database path, and command array.

All dashboard routes resolve paths through the project resolver. `/api/config`
returns available projects, the default project id, selected project summary,
project defaults, and default repo/state/graph paths. Request query strings and
POST bodies send `projectId` by default; raw repo/state/graph paths are applied
only when `usePathOverrides` is true.

Dashboard data comes from the resolved project context. It combines:

- SQLite run, queue, lease, event, report, checkpoint, and handoff state.
- Current board/report measures from the selected project checkout.
- Trusted `report_changes.json` data when the report is fresh for the run.
- Recent worker reports, touched files, active files, queue rows, and process
  logs.

The dashboard stream endpoint sends server-sent events at
`ORCH_UI_DASHBOARD_INTERVAL_MS` cadence. It emits the full dashboard payload
when stable state changes and compact tick payloads for elapsed-time updates.

## Layout

The React app has three regions:

- Left controls rail: compact project disclosure, run/process controls, and PR
  handoff controls.
- Center work area: progress metrics, trusted report or worker-score movement,
  improved files/symbols, and active/queued work.
- Right details rail: `Logs` and `Active Run` tabs. Logs are the default process
  view; Active Run holds worker report filters and full run details.

Both side rails are collapsible. The open left controls rail uses the same
responsive track as the open right details rail, `minmax(440px, 560px)`, so
handoff controls have enough horizontal space. Collapsed rails use a `44px`
icon strip and persist their collapsed state in `localStorage` as
`sidebarCollapsed` and `detailsCollapsed`.

## Process Controls

The Run section manages the long-running decomp process:

| UI Action | Endpoint | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Start` | `POST /api/process/start` | Starts the managed babysit process for an active run. The command includes `--project <id>` plus resolved repo/state/graph paths. The server refuses to start workers for a paused, complete, or failed run. |
| `Stop` | `POST /api/process/drain` | Requests a soft drain: child workers receive `SIGTERM`, and the supervisor is stopped so no new workers are introduced. |
| `Force Stop` | `POST /api/process/stop` | Stops the process group and runs `recover-leases --force` by default. |
| `Report Now` | `POST /api/report/run` | Runs the trusted report refresh flow through `forceReportRun`. |
| `Fresh Run` | `POST /api/run/fresh` | Optionally checkpoints the current run, resets the report baseline, initializes a new run, and refreshes PR knowledge. |

Run Setup exposes scheduling as a size preset instead of independent queue
numbers. The dashboard server derives `--max-workers`, `--queue-target-size`,
`--queue-low-watermark`, `--candidate-limit`, and `--candidate-window` from that
preset so the browser state cannot leave a mismatched worker/queue policy:

| Preset | Workers | Ready queue | Refill watermark |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Small | 4 | 16 | 4 |
| Medium | 8 | 32 | 8 |
| Large | 16 | 64 | 16 |
| XL | 32 | 128 | 32 |

The ready queue is the pool of queued targets that workers can lease. The
trigger refills that pool deterministically whenever it is below the target, and
requests a director replan when queued work falls to the refill watermark while
workers are active.

Fresh Run has a `Checkpoint before fresh` option enabled by default. This
preserves PR candidates and carry-forward work before the next baseline/session
is created.

## PR Handoff Controls

The PR Handoff section is the UI-facing sequence for pausing new work, keeping
the current run durable, running final QA, and producing reviewer-sized PR plan
artifacts.

| UI Action | Endpoint | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Pause Intake` | `POST /api/pr/pause` | Drains the managed process and marks the run `paused`. Worker and trigger commands reject non-active runs, so no new worker edits can be introduced until the run is resumed. |
| `Resume` | `POST /api/pr/resume` | Marks the run `active` again so scheduling can continue. |
| `Checkpoint` | `POST /api/run/checkpoint` | Calls `createRunCheckpoint` for the current run and writes `checkpoint.json`, `pr_candidates.md`, and `carry_forward.md`. |
| `Run QA` | `POST /api/pr/qa` | Runs `regression-check --require-pr-promotion` by default and returns the generated summary/report artifact paths even when the gate fails. |
| `Plan PRs` | `POST /api/pr/split-plan` | Runs `pr-split-plan` and writes a Markdown plan plus `summary.json` under the handoff artifact directory. |
| `Prepare` | `POST /api/pr/prepare` | Runs the combined pause, checkpoint, QA, and split-plan sequence. Split planning runs only if QA passes. |

The section also exposes the key QA and split-plan inputs:

- QA target, default `changes_all`.
- QA report row limit, default `300`.
- PR promotion requirement, enabled by default.
- Split base ref, default `origin/master`.
- Split group mode, `melee-subsystem` or `top-dir`.
- Maximum files per suggested PR.
- Branch/title prefixes.
- Whether to include untracked files or restrict to committed changes.

Latest handoff artifacts are summarized in the dashboard under
`dashboard.handoff`:

- `checkpoint`: latest `run_checkpoints` row plus disposition counts.
- `qa`: latest `state_dir/regression_checks/<run_id>/<timestamp>/summary.json`.
- `splitPlan`: latest
  `state_dir/pr_handoff/<run_id>/split_plans/<timestamp>/summary.json`.
