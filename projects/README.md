# Projects

The orchestrator is the platform repository. Project descriptors in this
directory tell it which checkout, state directory, graph database, process name,
and local defaults to use for a decomp project.

Tracked project descriptors live at:

```text
projects/<project-id>/project.json
```

Machine-specific overrides live at:

```text
projects/<project-id>/local.project.json
```

`local.project.json` is ignored. Use it for absolute checkout paths or temporary
local paths that should not be committed. Explicit CLI flags and dashboard
advanced path overrides still win over both tracked and local project config.

For Melee, either clone/worktree `doldecomp/melee` into
`projects/melee/checkout/` or create `projects/melee/local.project.json` with a
`repoRoot` that points at an existing external checkout.

PR defaults live under the descriptor's `pr` key. `splitStrategy` can be
`deterministic` or `agent`; the tracked Melee descriptor uses `agent` so
handoff planning asks the PR splitter to reshape the deterministic seed plan.
