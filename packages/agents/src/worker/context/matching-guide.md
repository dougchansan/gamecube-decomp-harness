# Worker Matching Guide

Use this opt-in context when the packet needs focused source editing,
duplicate adaptation, an isolated check loop, or type/symbol work tied to
compiler shape.

## Tactic Order

1. Start from natural source and local repo idioms.
2. Infer likely original developer conventions from matched siblings, nearby
   files, headers, macros, naming habits, and historical PR evidence.
3. Match the first concrete mismatch, not the whole function at once.
4. Change one source-shape axis per attempt and verify immediately.
5. Compare target and affected neighbors after every retained edit.
6. Prefer understandable source that can survive review over a fake local match.

## Common Levers

- Control flow: guard shape, single-case switch versus if, loop form, early
  return shape, condition spelling, and branch nesting.
- Locals and registers: declaration order, temporary lifetime, helper
  extraction, inline boundary, pointer/base caching, and variable splitting.
- Stack/frame: missing real locals, address-taken temporaries, lifetime across
  calls, stack arrays, scoped padding only when justified, and neighbor checks.
- Types and fields: replace offsets with known fields/accessors, recover union
  arms, use local naming, and keep `M2C_FIELD` only when the real field is not
  proven.
- Inlines/macros: prefer existing header inlines and canonical assert/report
  macros before manual expansion.
- Data/literals: treat these as high-risk secondary work. Check section
  ownership, literal order, static declarations, relocation targets, and split
  boundaries before adding or moving data, and do not chase data parity before
  the translation unit's text section is complete. Do not replace inline string
  literals with generated/global symbols unless explicit data-ownership evidence
  and scope require it.
- Globals/externs: use one canonical evidence-backed name. Do not introduce
  `#define` aliases for renamed variables or duplicate address-commented
  externs under different names.
- Duplicate adaptation: use matched siblings or duplicate assembly groups as
  evidence, then adjust names/types to the current subsystem instead of copying
  blindly.

## Tool-Assisted Matching Loop

1. Use `opseq_similar_functions` or `tool_outputs_similar_functions` before
   duplicate adaptation or broad local rewrites to find already-matched
   instruction-shape analogs and near-neighbor functions.
2. Use `mismatch_db_search` or `tool_outputs_mismatch_patterns` after the first
   concrete objdiff/checkdiff mismatch to name the symptom and retrieve known
   source-shape tactics.
3. Use `mwcc_debug_lookup` notes when the remaining mismatch appears
   MWCC-specific: register allocation, stack/frame layout, local lifetime,
   coalescing, scheduling, varargs/assert/report layout, or hard-to-explain
   compiler shape.
4. Use `mwcc_debug_diagnose_stack`, `mwcc_debug_diagnose_regflow`, or
   `mwcc_debug_diagnose_inlines` only after a concrete checkdiff/objdiff
   symptom points at that mode. Use `mwcc_debug_dump_function` or
   `mwcc_debug_raw_dump` when summarized diagnosis is not enough.
5. Use `type_oracle_lookup` before extracting a temporary or changing a
   pointer/value type. Use `struct_infer_from_asm` when a specific pointer
   register's offset pattern needs layout evidence.
6. Use `ghidra_lookup` as a second opinion for names, calls, strings, types, and
   control context. Do not paste decompiler output or let it outrank source,
   headers, symbols, splits, assembly, or objdiff.
7. Use `source_mutation_preview`, `source_permuter_run`, or
   `source_permuter_replay` only as last-resort source-shape exploration. The
   worker profile uses non-mutating defaults; inspect the diff and keep only
   understood, reviewable source edits.
8. Do not chase register allocation first. Fix instruction sequence, call shape,
   source structure, types, and data ownership before treating register diffs as
   the root cause.

## MWCC Pattern Checklist

- Declaration order can affect data/helper placement and source shape.
- `int` versus `s32` can affect loop compare, unroll, and codegen shape because
  `s32` is a typedef to `long`.
- Wrong `void` or return signatures create durable caller mismatch noise. Fix
  headers first, then recompile callers before judging the body mismatch.
- Reusing one natural pointer local can be closer to MWCC output than splitting
  every load.
- `static` versus `extern`, direct global access, and BSS declaration order can
  explain data access and relocation differences.
- Varargs/report/assert forms perturb stack layout. Prefer known project macro
  and inline forms before manual expansions.
- Multiple `Vec3` locals and by-value helper calls can affect stack reservation.
  Test declaration order and missing inlines before padding.
- If the instruction body is identical and only relocations or labels differ,
  treat it as a symbol/data layout problem, not a C rewrite problem.

## Stack-Frame Triage

Most stack-layout bucket mismatches are compound. Treat a stack/frame edit as a
clean local-padding candidate only when opcodes and line count are the same, the
frame-size or stack-slot delta is isolated, and diffs normalize to `r1` stack
offsets. Otherwise classify the gap as source-shape, call-shape,
register/operand cascade, or compound evidence before editing.

## Guardrails

- A high fuzzy score is a clue, not success. For matched-code runs, exact 100%
  symbol closure is the useful target.
- Do not keep a target improvement that regresses a matched neighbor unless the
  packet explicitly allows a broader tradeoff and the report names it.
- Do not introduce fake statics, fake helpers, undefined behavior, or macro
  redefinitions to force a match.
- Do not retain data, literal, symbol, or split edits that create section
  regression noise unless they are required for the code match or explicitly
  scoped as data cleanup.
- Do not replace source string literals with data symbols to chase data parity.
- Do not use defines to make guessed global names look canonical.
- Forced MWCC/debug outputs are hypothesis tests, not source proof. Keep only
  source shapes that reproduce the improvement through an unforced local
  build/objdiff check.
- Use last-resort sweep/permuter tooling only after a named source-shape axis is
  too tedious to test manually.
