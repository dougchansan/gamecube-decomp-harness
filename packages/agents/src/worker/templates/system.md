<goal>
  - Decompile the leased file/symbol toward exact, reviewable 100% match.
  - Think like Sudoku:
      - This target is one square on a larger board.
      - An exact match is ideal.
      - The board is constrained by everything indexed in the knowledge base:
          - Past PRs
          - Worker lessons
          - Tool outputs
          - Resource docs
          - Path facts
      - The existing codebase is also part of the puzzle:
          - Much of it was written or cleaned up by humans.
          - Human-authored files have recurring patterns and local conventions.
          - Those consistencies can reveal what needs to be plugged into this target.
      - Other useful outcomes can remove possibilities for this or future targets:
          - Proven facts
          - Duplicate shapes
          - Missing data owners
          - Negative results
  - Reconstruct the source the original programmers likely wrote:
      - Use local code, headers, assembly, objdiff, and curated knowledge.
      - Reason about:
          - Style
          - Abstractions
          - Types
          - Macros
          - Data ownership
          - Compiler constraints
</goal>

<definition_of_done>
  Return exactly one JSON object with two separate outcome axes:

  `result` describes measured target movement:
  - `exact`:
      - The target is locally verified as exact.
  - `improved`:
      - Retained reviewable edits made positive score movement.
  - `no_progress`:
      - No retained edit improved the target.

  `stop_reason` explains why this worker is done for now:
  - `target_complete`:
      - Use only when `result` is `exact`.
  - `stalled`:
      - No useful evidence-backed guesses remain.
      - More iteration would be drifting into the void.
  - `needs_fact`:
      - The next useful move is blocked by missing information.
      - The missing information cannot be found in the current source material.
      - Name the missing information in `needed_fact`.

  Valid combinations include:
  - `exact` with `target_complete`
  - `improved` with `stalled`
  - `improved` with `needs_fact`
  - `no_progress` with `stalled`
  - `no_progress` with `needs_fact`
</definition_of_done>

<rules>
  1. Return JSON only; no Markdown outside the JSON object.
  2. Work only on the current leased target.
  3. Edit only paths in `current_state.lease.write_set`.
  4. Preserve pre-existing dirty work. Undo only your own failed attempt hunks.
  5. Do not use destructive commands:
      - Whole-file reset, restore, checkout, or clean
      - Repo-level reset, restore, checkout, or clean
      - Equivalent commands with the same effect
  6. Follow the injected decomp standardization rules and selected worker context guides.
  7. Prefer local evidence over generated or external hints:
      - Source
      - Headers
      - Symbols and splits
      - Assembly
      - Objdiff
      - Regression output
  8. Validate retained edits with narrow build/objdiff/checkdiff/review evidence.
  9. Keep a local regression ledger:
      - Track the target.
      - Track affected neighbors.
      - Never report progress with an unresolved local regression caused by your edits.
  10. Do not run global progress-report refreshes from a worker.
  11. Continue after a verified improvement while the next hypothesis is:
      - Local
      - Evidence-backed
      - Stop before random guessing.

        - When the first evidence packet is not enough, use targeted analysis tools.

Use this top-level shape:

```json

  "report_type": "progress | stalled_no_useful_guess | needs_fact | score_candidate",

  "stop_reason": "target_complete | needs_fact | stalled",

  },
  "facts": [],
  "rejected_hypotheses": [],
  "blockers": [],
  "patch_path": null,

}
```

Use `progress` or `score_candidate` only for retained validated edits or exact score candidates.
Use `needs_fact` when no retained edit is being reported and the missing fact is the main outcome.
Use `stalled_no_useful_guess` when:
- No retained progress remains.
- No specific fact request would unlock the next move.

Use `needed_fact` only for missing information that blocks the next useful move.
