# Worker Operating Guide

Default worker context. Use this as the compact operating contract for one
leased Melee decomp target.

## Work Shape

1. Confirm the lease: target, unit, symbol, source path, write set, budget, stop
   rule, and worker log directory.
2. Build a small evidence packet before editing: local source, sibling matched
   functions, relevant headers/macros, symbols/splits, report metadata, first
   mismatch shape, any useful PR/resource hits, and knowledge-tool lookups when
   the source path, symbol, opcode pattern, or compiler-shape question is
   concrete.
3. Edit one source dimension at a time. Keep attempts small enough that a bad
   hunk can be removed without touching unrelated dirty work.
4. Verify with the narrowest relevant command after every attempt. Keep a local
   regression ledger for the target and cheap affected-neighbor checks.
5. Keep verified improvements and continue while evidence-backed nearby
   hypotheses remain. Stop before random guessing.
6. Return a durable report: retained patch status, validation evidence, local
   regression state, useful facts, negative evidence, and blockers.

## Hard Rules

- Edit only files in `current_state.lease.write_set`.
- Treat files already known to be exact 100% complete as read-only references.
  If a packet asks you to edit only complete files, report a scheduling blocker.
- Never run whole-file or repo-level destructive reset/restore/clean commands.
- Never run global progress-report refresh commands from a worker.
- Preserve pre-existing dirty work. Undo only hunks introduced by the current
  failed attempt.
- Do not report `progress` or `score_candidate` with an unresolved local
  regression caused by retained worker edits.

## Source Quality

- Recover natural loops from repeated generated blocks before keeping unrolled
  or goto-heavy source.
- Prefer real structs, fields, accessors, and union arms over raw pointer
  arithmetic. Use `M2C_FIELD` only as a temporary evidence-backed bridge.
- Map `__assert("jobj.h", line, ...)` back to existing `jobj.h` inlines when
  the line number identifies one.
- Prefer project assert/report macros and local idioms over hand-expanded
  asserts or fake helper shapes.
- Scope pragmas tightly and keep them only when natural source forms have failed
  and objdiff evidence justifies the tradeoff.
- Treat m2c, Ghidra, AI, permuter output, and knowledge-tool pattern notes as
  candidate material, never as trusted source. Keep edits only after local
  source review and narrow objdiff/checkdiff validation.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and report a blocker when progress requires a missing type, field, data
owner, symbol, verifier, or broader scheduling decision. Stop as
`stalled_no_useful_guess` when remaining options are speculative or would be
broad mechanical search without a named source-shape axis. If tool lookups only
return broad register/allocation hints, stale notes, or fallback metadata, and no
bounded source-shape axis remains, preserve the negative evidence and stop
instead of perturbing source randomly.
