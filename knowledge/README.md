# Decomp Orchestrator Knowledge

This directory is the runtime evidence surface for the orchestrator. It owns
source corpora, normalized tool-output evidence, and the shared resource graph.
Callable tool suites live in the top-level `tools/` tree.

Agent role behavior and prompt context live beside the agents under
`src/agents/*/context/`. Historical role/workflow docs live under
`docs/archive/`, not here.

Reusable corpora:

- `sources/` - shallow vertical slices for knowledge sources such as the code
  graph, past PRs, Discord knowledge, data sheets, PowerPC docs, external
  mirrors, and normalized tool outputs. Each slice has `data/`
  so the actual corpus path is visible from the slice.
- `resource_graph/` - generated SQLite graph state, graph schemas/placeholders,
  graph command notes, generated graph-level indexes, and graph-owned
  enrichment artifacts.

Where the actual corpora live:

- PRs: `knowledge/sources/past_prs/data/current` for fetched PR data and
  `knowledge/sources/past_prs/data/prs` for processed postmortems/indexes.
- Discord knowledge: `knowledge/sources/discord_knowledge/data/docs`.
- Data sheet: `knowledge/sources/ssbm_data_sheet/data`.
- PowerPC PDFs: `knowledge/sources/powerpc_docs/data`.
- External mirrors: `knowledge/sources/external_mirrors/data`.
- Resource guides/manifests: `knowledge/sources/resource_guides/data`.
- Imported reference docs/legacy skills: `knowledge/sources/reference_docs/data`.
- Tool integrations: `tools/<category>/<tool_id>`, with generated caches under
  each tool's `cache/` folder.
- Legacy shared agent-state lessons:
  `knowledge/resource_graph/enrichments/agent_shared_state_lessons.jsonl`.
  This is an internal graph enrichment, not a source slice; it is generated from
  a legacy SQLite DB and keeps only durable tool/function lessons.
- Knowledge curator updates:
  `knowledge/resource_graph/enrichments/knowledge_curator_updates.jsonl`.
  This generated enrichment is reduced from worker reports and PR postmortems.
  It can contain accepted worker/PR lessons plus proposal-only updates for
  source slices such as the data sheet or tool-output indexes. It is ingestion
  output, not a registered source that workers query directly.

Package command surface:

- `bun run kg:sources` lists registered source slices and external tools.
- `bun run kg:import-agent-state -- --input agent_state-shared.db` imports a
  legacy shared agent-state DB into the graph-owned enrichment JSONL.
- `bun run kg:curate -- --state-dir <state_dir>` rewrites curator enrichment
  records from worker reports and PR postmortems.
- `bun run kg:maintain -- --state-dir <state_dir> --repo-root <repo_root>` runs
  pending PR postmortem indexing, tool index generation, curator reduction, and
  graph rebuild.
- `bun run kg:rebuild -- --repo-root <repo_root>` rebuilds the v1 graph from
  all registered source slices, normalized tool outputs, and any available
  graph enrichments.
- `bun run kg:tool-indexes -- --repo-root <repo_root>` generates local JSONL
  indexes for the callable tool APIs.
- `bun run kg:smoke -- --strict` verifies every registered source has a graph
  version/search chunks and every registered tool API reports ready.
- `bun run kg:file-card -- --repo-root <repo_root> --source <source_path>`
  returns file graph context, editability, PR history, and rank signals.
- `bun run kg:search -- --repo-root <repo_root> --source past_prs --query <term>`
  searches indexed graph chunks.
- `bun run kg:rank-features -- --repo-root <repo_root>` shows graph-derived
  ranking features for board candidates.
- `python3 knowledge/sources/<source_id>/api/status.py --json` checks
  source-local index readiness for any registered source.
- `python3 knowledge/sources/<source_id>/api/search.py --query <term> --json`
  searches that source's generated JSONL indexes without going through a graph
  rebuild.
- `python3 tools/<category>/<tool_id>/api/status.py --json` and each tool's
  lookup/search API provide direct CLI access to generated tool evidence.
- `bun run pr:refresh:dry` previews recent PR discovery.
- `bun run pr:refresh` refreshes missing PR slices and rebuilds deterministic
  searchable records.
- `bun run pr:refresh:all` refreshes the full PR corpus with 32 fetch workers
  and 32 PR-review workers.
- `bun run pr:postmortems -- --dump-root knowledge/sources/past_prs/data/current --run-agent`
  reruns model-reviewed PR records.
- `bun run pr:sync` syncs the local branch and PR library together.
- `bun run pr:sync:all` syncs the branch and then refreshes the full PR corpus
  with 32-way fetch/postmortem processing.

Bootstrap status, 2026-06-06:

- Full PR corpus fetched and model-reviewed: `2501 / 2501` PR postmortems are
  `agent_completed`.
- Registered source APIs and registered tool APIs have passing status/search
  smoke checks.
- `bun run kg:tool-indexes`, `bun run kg:rebuild -- --sources all`, and
  `bun run kg:smoke -- --strict` pass against the current graph.
