# GameCube Decomp Harness

GameCube Decomp Harness is a Bun/TypeScript workspace for coordinating
high-parallelism decompilation runs. It gives a GameCube decomp project a
durable agent control plane: many Pi worker agents can research, edit, validate,
and report in parallel while sharing one run board, one knowledge graph, and one
set of project-specific safety rails.

The current tracked project is Melee, but the harness is organized around
`projects/<id>/project.json` descriptors so the same machinery can be pointed at
other GameCube decompilation workspaces.

## What It Does

- Runs director and worker Pi agents against queued decompilation targets.
- Coordinates many workers through SQLite leases, file locks, events, reports,
  and run artifacts instead of agent-to-agent chat.
- Feeds agents from a shared knowledge graph of docs, workflows, tools, past PRs,
  decomp resources, and project-specific facts.
- Keeps long-running sessions inspectable through a dense dashboard with process
  controls, worker reports, queue state, progress panels, and handoff surfaces.
- Wraps validation and handoff flows such as smoke runs, score regression checks,
  PR slice planning, and knowledge refresh.

The intent is not to replace maintainers or project-specific build systems. The
harness automates the repetitive search, edit, validate, and report loop so a
human can supervise progress and review the work that survives validation.

## Quick Start

Install dependencies and run the local checks:

```sh
bun install
bun run check
bun run smoke
```

`bun run smoke` uses dry-run agents and fixture data, so it does not require a
live provider or edit a real decompilation checkout.

Inspect the server job surface:

```sh
bun run server:job -- --project melee status
```

Launch the dashboard when you want the browser control surface:

```sh
bun run ui
```

The dashboard serves at `http://localhost:8787` by default.

## Live Project Setup

The tracked Melee descriptor defaults to `projects/melee/checkout/`. For local
work, either place a `doldecomp/melee` checkout there or create ignored
`projects/melee/local.project.json` with machine-specific paths for the repo,
state directory, graph database, env file, and process defaults.

Live agent sessions need:

- Bun, Python 3, and Git.
- A configured GameCube decompilation checkout with its normal build and objdiff
  tooling.
- Pi provider/auth configuration for the selected provider, model, and thinking
  level.
- Project-local secrets in ignored env files such as
  `projects/melee/local.env`.

Keep literal API keys and generated session state out of tracked files.

## Typical Run Shape

Initialize a run:

```sh
bun run server:job -- --project melee init-run \
  --desired-workers 16 \
  --goal-kind matched_code_percent \
  --goal-value 72
```

Run the supervised worker loop:

```sh
bun run server:job -- --project melee --agent-timeout-seconds 14400 babysit \
  --max-workers 16 \
  --idle-sleep-ms 5000 \
  --worker-thinking-level low
```

Before review or handoff, run the regression gate:

```sh
bun run server:job -- --project melee regression-check
```

For high-throughput runs, tune worker count, queue size, candidate windows, graph
ranking, and lease recovery flags from server jobs or the dashboard. The detailed
operational notes live in the docs.
